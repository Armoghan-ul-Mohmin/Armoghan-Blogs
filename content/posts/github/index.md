GitHub is the go-to place for storing source code for developers. You are missing out on all the good bits of GitHub if you only use it for storing your code. Using GitHub to its full potential will make your life as a developer easier and more productive. In this article, I’ll show you all the great stuff you can do with GitHub.

Let’s go from the most used features to the lesser-known ones.
