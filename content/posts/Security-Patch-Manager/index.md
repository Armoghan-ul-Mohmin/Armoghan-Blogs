In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the critical task of maintaining the security of computer systems demands efficiency and precision. The **Security Patch Manager**, a Bash script developed by *Armoghan-ul-Mohmin*, stands as a testament to the commitment to robust cybersecurity practices. This script serves as a powerful tool for administrators, automating the process of checking and applying system security updates on Linux-based systems.

##  Introduction

###  Background

In the dynamic world of cybersecurity, the significance of promptly applying system security updates cannot be overstated. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, making it imperative to ensure that systems are equipped with the latest defenses. The Security Patch Manager emerges as a solution to the challenge of managing security updates efficiently.

###  Project Objective

The core objective of the Security Patch Manager project is to create a user-friendly and efficient Bash script. This script aims to automate the often time-consuming process of managing system security updates. By providing administrators with a streamlined tool, the script enhances the overall security posture of Linux-based systems.

##  Script Overview

###  Features

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The script incorporates an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface. It includes a dynamic ASCII banner, color-coded messages, and interactive menu options, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

2. **Root Privilege Handling**: To ensure the script can perform necessary system operations, it checks for root privileges. Users have the option to run the script with elevated permissions using the `--root` option.

3. **Update Listing**: Users can easily view available security updates in a neatly formatted table. The use of color-coded text enhances visibility and simplifies the identification of relevant information.

4. **Live Progress Bar**: When applying security updates, the script provides real-time feedback through a live progress bar. This feature keeps users informed about the ongoing update process.

5. **Autoclean and Autoremove**: The script includes options to execute `apt autoclean` and `apt autoremove` with improved formatting. This enhances the overall user experience by presenting results in a more organized and readable manner.

###  Script Flow
